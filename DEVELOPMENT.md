# Development
**Week One**\
*4/8/19*\
To start development I began thinking about ideas that I would like to create. After some thought I decided that I wanted to make an old school platformer game. I started development by pulling up one of the examples and using it as inspiration for how to start and for basic setup/boilerplate code.

*4/9/19*\
I continued development by first adding a little more setup code. I finished up the code that allows the window to jump from full screen to back again. I also created a very basic black and white background that moves across the screen to give the illusion of movement.

Additionally, today I began looking for an outside library that would augment my game and meet the outside library requirement. After some searching I discovered ofxGameOfLife (see link at end of this entry). This library splits a window into a bunch of tiny grids. The grids can be individually filled and accessed. While I dind't initially have this in mind I quickly realized that this library could be used to make an pixelled old school looking game. I began experimenting with the libary and figuring out how to implement it in my final project.

Finally, today I finished writing up my proposal.
