# Project Proposal

## General Overview

  For my final project I would like to create a platformer game. The game that I have in mind will be a classic platformer where the user controls a character that must jump over obstacles. It would be a 2D game that has the user move across the screen and would take inspiration from the chrome dino game that you can play when there is no internet. It could start slow and slowly speed up to increase the difficulty like most games of this genre.
 
 The game will obviously be created using openFrameworks and since it is a game it can leverage a windowed interface very nicelly.
 
 **Potential Features**
 1. The actual platform game
 2. A menu that allows for the pausing of a game, seeing the high scores, and toggling settings
 3. A list of highest scores on that machine that is saved to a file
 4. Sound for each movement the character can take and the ability to toggle it on and off
 5. Difficulty settings which would change how points are scored
 6. Varying obstacles which will make the game more interesting

## Outside Library

Sound drastically adds to any game, but in this case I only have small plans for how to use sound, so I don't plan on using a sound library as my main outside library.
